### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The AWS working environment exceeded my expectations. The office space is modern and equipped with cutting-edge technology that supports innovation. The culture emphasizes customer obsession and ownership, which I found very motivating. Teams collaborate across different services and regions seamlessly. The open-door policy made it easy to reach out to senior engineers and learn from their expertise. I especially appreciated the inclusive atmosphere where interns are treated as valuable contributors.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor at AWS was exceptional. They took time to explain complex AWS services and cloud architecture concepts, ensuring I understood both the "what" and the "why" behind technical decisions. Weekly 1-on-1 sessions helped me track my progress and set clear goals. The team admin efficiently handled onboarding, AWS account setup, and provided access to necessary tools like AWS Console, CloudFormation templates, and internal documentation. The mentor encouraged me to experiment with services in sandbox environments, which accelerated my hands-on learning.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
As a Computer Science student, the internship perfectly bridged theory and practice. I applied concepts from distributed systems, networking, and database courses while working with services like EC2, Lambda, RDS, and VPC. The experience with Infrastructure as Code, serverless architecture, and DevOps practices went beyond my curriculum, providing invaluable industry-relevant skills. Working on real customer use cases helped me understand how academic knowledge translates to solving business problems at scale.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The learning opportunities at AWS were extraordinary. I gained hands-on experience with core AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch), learned CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild, and practiced Infrastructure as Code with CDK and CloudFormation. I also earned AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification with company support. Regular tech talks, internal workshops, and access to AWS Training resources significantly enhanced my cloud computing expertise. The experience with agile methodologies and sprint planning was invaluable.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
AWS's leadership principles are truly lived, not just written. The culture of "Learn and Be Curious" and "Bias for Action" empowered me to take initiative on projects. Team members from diverse backgrounds brought unique perspectives, fostering innovation. During incident responses, I witnessed firsthand how teams collaborate across silos to resolve issues quickly. The culture of blameless post-mortems and continuous improvement created a safe learning environment. Even as an intern, my ideas were heard and sometimes implemented.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
AWS provided competitive compensation, AWS credits for personal learning projects, and access to all AWS services in sandbox environments. The benefits included mentorship programs, intern events, networking sessions with leadership, and professional development resources. The flexible work arrangement (hybrid model) helped maintain work-life balance. Most importantly, interns were given meaningful projects with real impact, not just busy work. The potential for conversion to full-time roles based on performance was a strong motivator.

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
The most satisfying aspect was seeing my project go live and being used by internal teams. I built a serverless monitoring dashboard using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB that helped reduce incident response time. Receiving positive feedback from the team and knowing my work created tangible value was incredibly rewarding. Additionally, the technical growth I experienced in just a few months was remarkable.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
While the experience was excellent, I suggest:
- More structured introduction to AWS's internal tools and systems during onboarding
- Earlier exposure to different teams through rotation programs
- More frequent social events specifically for interns to build peer networks
- Clearer documentation on internal processes and escalation paths
- Opportunities to present intern projects to broader audiences

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
Absolutely yes! I would highly recommend AWS internship to friends interested in cloud computing, distributed systems, or software engineering. The combination of working on meaningful projects, learning from world-class engineers, experiencing Amazon's unique culture, and building expertise in the most widely-used cloud platform makes it an unparalleled opportunity. The experience has significantly accelerated my career trajectory and opened doors I didn't know existed.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**  
- Create a "buddy system" pairing interns with recent hires for peer support
- Organize optional weekend hackathons focused on emerging AWS services
- Provide more opportunities for interns to shadow different roles (Solutions Architect, DevOps, Security)
- Establish an intern alumni network for continued learning and mentorship
- Offer AWS certification exam vouchers for additional certifications beyond Cloud Practitioner

**Would you like to continue this program in the future?**  
Definitely! I would love to return as a full-time employee or participate in advanced internship programs. The experience confirmed my passion for cloud technologies and large-scale distributed systems. I'm particularly interested in pursuing opportunities in serverless architecture, DevOps engineering, or solutions architecture within AWS. The First Cloud Journey bootcamp combined with the AWS internship has prepared me well for these paths.

**Any other comments (free sharing):**  
This internship at AWS transformed my understanding of cloud computing from theoretical concepts to practical expertise. The exposure to real-world production systems, the scale at which AWS operates, and the customer-centric approach has shaped my engineering mindset. I'm grateful for the mentorship, the challenging projects, and the supportive team environment. The skills and confidence I gained will benefit me throughout my career. Thank you to the FCJ program for facilitating this opportunity and to my AWS team for making it memorable. I look forward to contributing to the cloud computing industry and potentially returning to AWS in the future.
